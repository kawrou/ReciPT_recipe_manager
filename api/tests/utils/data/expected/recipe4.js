  recipeIngredient: [
    "300g basmati rice",
    "2 tbsp olive oil",
    "1kg free-range chicken thighs and drumsticks",
    "1 large onion, finely sliced",
    "Pinch saffron threads",
    "700ml chicken stock, hot",
    "4 garlic cloves, finely sliced",
    "Finely grated zest and juice 1 lemon",
    "2 tbsp shelled pistachios, toasted in a dry frying pan",
    "20g dill",
    "4 tbsp pomegranate seeds",
  ],
  recipeInstructions: [
    "Put the rice in a bowl, cover with cold water, swish it around, then drain. Repeat this a few times until the water runs clear, then cover again with water and set aside to soak.",
    "In a large pan or casserole (one with a lid), heat the oil over a medium-high heat and add the chicken skin-side down in a single layer (work in batches if you need to). Cook for about 8 minutes until the skin is really crisp and golden. Turn over and cook for 2 more minutes, then lift the pieces onto a plate.",
    "Add the onion to the pan and cook over a medium heat for 8 minutes. Meanwhile, put the saffron in the hot stock to infuse. Stir the garlic into the onion and cook for another minute. Drain the rice and add to the pan. Stir for a minute, then add the saffron stock, a good pinch of salt, the lemon zest and juice, pistachios and most of the dill and pomegranate seeds. Stir together well, then top with the chicken and cover with a tight-fitting lid.",
    "Return to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low to simmer gently for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat without removing the lid, then leave for 10 minutes to finish steaming. Scatter the remaining pomegranate seeds and dill over to serve.",
